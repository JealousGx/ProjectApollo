This is the circuit board for the main control circuit. The basic functions are:

 * Control all valves and fans
 * Monitor sensors
 * Monitor and alert for faults

The project is described and discussed in more detail here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeXxTnBCQq67ddYeBdUPdo_KXUIRMmLPwQMJQMkbk8E/

The software used is Autodesk Eagle 9.

Please make your contributions on your own branches, as it's a nightmare merging changes to these files.

Please do not use default Eagle library components, add them to the local project .LBR file before adding them to the schematic. This ensures that everybody is using the same part and gives us the flexibility to fine tune the components.
